    p.
      Anorectal malformation is among the more common congenital diseases, with a prevalence of 
      1 in 2000 to 1 in 5000 live births. The current solutions are expensive, and as the companies
      that make the devices went out of business, the machines used for the surgery cannot be
      adequately serviced. This leaves a unique situation where only a few major hospitals across
      entire countries are the only ones left with the devices, and patients require travel to these
      specific hospitals to have this surgery performed. The current technology used in the surgery
      works by sending an electrical impulse, this in turn causes muscular contraction which the
      physician will observe to determine the site of the incision. Unfortunately, this is a subjective
      approach and could result in dire consequences in the case of inaccuracies in choosing an
      incision site. Our technology hopes to remove the subjectivity from the equation and instead
      read the strength of the electrical feedback from the muscular response to objectively
      determine the site of incision.

    p. 
      Primarily, it is important to remove subjectivity from the surgical process and to provide the
      surgeon with a more objective view. It is expected at this stage that we will have prototypes of
      this response analyzer device design made of some cheap materials such as craft or plastics.
      Previously, Dr. De la Torre’s lab has developed a functioning electrical stimulation device that
      can elicit a clear response from the muscles. Therefore, we wish to develop a device to read and
      interpret these signals and calculate the center of the sphincter to assist the surgeon in making
      the incision at the proper location. If accomplished successfully, this device will improve the
      accuracy of the surgery. The final deliverable would be a device that can both carry out the
      stimulation, analyze the tissue response, and provide the surgeon with the location of the
      sphincter’s center.

    p. 
      We are progressing on the assumption that the electrical stimulation method works, otherwise
      we would need to consider another method of tissue analysis, such as an optical method. We
      assume we will be able to breadboard this circuit and have access to necessary materials such
      as the board, resistors, wires, etc. Finally, we assume we may test this circuit on tissue that
      would provide response, such as a chicken or pig (deceased) muscle tissue and assume that the
      signal strength would be sufficient for the device to read, although it may not necessarily be
      representative of the signal resulting from human muscular contraction, and would need to be
      tested further.

    p. 
      We plan on further testing this device to be compatible with our simulated waveforms.
      Importantly, it should be able to determine the intensities of the inputs on either “side” of the
      center to identify the location of the center point. The bounds of this are limited by the
      capabilities of available waveform generator devices, and waveforms that are step, sinusoidal,
      ramp or square. This does stop short of using various tissue samples of deceased animals,
      which we anticipate will be the next step and require a new charter be signed.

    p. 
      Future goals which are currently outside the scope of the project are live animal testing prior to
      testing the device on humans. This will likely need Pitt IRB approval. This is an important
      stage to the device due to its eventual use in surgical procedures on humans, but is not currently
      within the scope of this project.
